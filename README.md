# Scratch

**Scratch is just an electron text area app. It stores the window contents to local storage.**

It's meant to be a small scratch pad for quick notes or text. I often find myself opening a TextEdit window for simple text manipulation or writing down a quick note that doesn't need a saved file. This is just a barebones implementation of a way to jot a quick note without having all the prompts to mess with files.
